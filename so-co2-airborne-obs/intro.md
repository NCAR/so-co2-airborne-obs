## Abstract

The Southern Ocean plays an important role in determining atmospheric CO2, yet estimates of air-sea CO2 flux for the region diverge widely. We constrain Southern Ocean air-sea CO2 exchange by relating fluxes to horizontal and vertical CO2 gradients in atmospheric transport models and then apply atmospheric observations of these gradients to estimate fluxes. Aircraft-based measurements of the vertical atmospheric CO2 gradient provide robust flux constraints. We find an annual-mean flux of –0.55±0.23 Pg C yr$^{–1}$ (net uptake) south of 45°S during 2009–2018. This is consistent with the mean of atmospheric-inversion estimates and surface-ocean pCO2-based products, but our data indicate stronger annual-mean uptake than suggested by recent interpretations of profiling-float observations.

**Observed patterns in atmospheric CO2 over the Southern Ocean.** Upper panels: Cross-sections observed by aircraft during (A) ORCAS, Jan–Feb 2016 and (B) ATom-1, Aug 2016. Colors show the observed CO2 dry air mole fraction relative to the average observed within the 295–305 K potential temperature range south of 45°S on each campaign; contour lines show the observed potential temperature. See Figs S1–S2 for flight-tracks and cross-section plots for all campaigns and Figures S3–S4 for simulated fields. Lower panels: Compilation of mean CO2 observed at surface monitoring stations minus the NOAA in situ record at the South Pole Observatory (SPO) over 1999–2019 for (C) summer (DJF) and (D) winter (JJA). The black line is a spline fit provided simply as a visual guide. Blue shading denotes the latitude band in which we designate “Southern Ocean stations.” See Table S1 and Figure S5 for station locations and temporal coverage. Supplementary Material includes additional methodological details.
