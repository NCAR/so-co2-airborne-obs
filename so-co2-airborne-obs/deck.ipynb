    "\n",
    "The Southern Ocean plays an important role in determining atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, yet estimates of air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> flux for the region diverge widely.\n",
    "Here we present an analysis in which we estimate Southern Ocean air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes using aircraft observations of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.\n",
    "Using a collection of transport models, we \"calibrate\" a relationship between the flux and the lower-troposphere vertical CO<sub>2</sub> gradient over the Southern Ocean.\n",
    "Using data from aircraft campaigns conducted over 2009–2018, we find a Southern Ocean flux of –0.55±0.23 Pg C yr<sup>–1</sup> (net uptake) south of 45°S.\n",
    "We also examine the use of surface-based atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> measurements.\n",
    "The horizontal gradients captured by these observations do not provide as robust constraints on the fluxes as the vertical gradients accessible from aircraft.\n",
    "However, the inferences from surface observations are consistent with the aircraft-based flux estimates, and suggest a trend of increasing Southern Ocean uptake since 2005."

The uncertainty estimate on the SOCAT and SOCCOM fluxes is approximated from {cite:t}`Bushinsky2019-ha`, who report ±0.15 Pg C yr<sup>-1</sup> as the “method uncertainty” associated with the neural-network-based flux estimates for the whole Southern Ocean (south of 44°S). Note that while s99oc_v2020 and s99c_SOCAT+SOCCOM_v2020 are global inversions, their ocean fluxes are prescribed, not optimized using atmospheric observations; similarly, the CAMS(v20r1) ocean fluxes remain close to its SOCAT pCO<sub>2</sub>-based prior."
