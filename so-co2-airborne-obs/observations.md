Atmospheric CO2 observations
============================

We use observations from nine deployments of three recent aircraft projects: the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) project (18); the O2/N2 Ratio and CO2 Airborne Southern Ocean (ORCAS) study (19); and the Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) mission (20) (see Supplementary Material, hereafter SM). We also examined 44 atmospheric CO2 records from surface monitoring stations in the high-latitude Southern Hemisphere, selecting and filtering the highest quality data (SM).
