Model simulations
=================

We develop inferences about air-sea CO2 fluxes from these gradient metrics by examining a collection of atmospheric inverse models that simulate time-varying, three-dimensional CO2 fields sampled to replicate observations (SM). The inverse models demonstrate that seasonality in ∆θCO2 and ∆yCO2 is dominated by Southern Ocean air-sea fluxes.
